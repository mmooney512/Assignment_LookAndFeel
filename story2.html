                            <h3>ROOM 4 DESSERT, UBUD, BALI </h3>
                            <h4>A Balinese remake by a New York pastry wizard</h4>
                            
                            Will Goldfarb is the Willy Wonka of Bali. His story started in 
                            New York: after a stint at Spain’s El Bulli and a few pastry-chef 
                            roles, he struck gold with the original Room 4 Dessert, a 20-seater
                            pudding bar in Nolita that quickly obtained rave reviews as well as 
                            regulars including film director Wes Anderson.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            When it was shuttered following a fallout with his partners, 
                            Goldfarb upped sticks and relaunched it in Bali – this time 
                            flanked by palm trees, with ingredients such as fresh cocoa, 
                            palm sugar and soursop on his doorstep. His all-pudding tasting 
                            menu features Incidente Stradale, mixing jamu, a traditional tonic, 
                            with coconut and coffee, while Angel’s Kiss is made with jackfruit, 
                            pandan and mango. All of his creations are paired with wine or a cocktail
                            – the Planifoglia, a cheesecake-like sabayon, is matched with a 
                            vodka-based mangosteen and hibiscus concoction.
                        </p>

                            From April the surrounding gardens will also be put to work, 
                            meaning medicinal herbs will be picked minutes before 
                            they’re used. Combining Goldfarb’s skills with his passion for 
                            Bali’s local ingredients has been a sweet success – this is the 
                            most exciting restaurant in Indonesia, if not Asia, right now.

                            <h3>BARR, COPENHAGEN</h3>
                            <h4>The Nordic food revolution continues with an upstart in Noma's old home</h4>
                            
                            After René Redzepi moved his game-changing restaurant, 
                            Noma, from its warehouse on Copenhagen’s harbourfront, a 
                            restaurant called Barr arrived to inhabit its space. With Redzepi 
                            a co-owner, its head chef, Thorsten Schmidt, knew he had to find a 
                            way to fill the shoes of its lauded predecessor. So rather than exploring 
                            the Nordic region, he embraced flavours inspired by Denmark’s southerly 
                            neighbours, the lands of beer and meatballs. But what meatballs! Following 
                            epic tasting sessions, Schmidt led with venison and wild duck frikadeller, 
                            which have been a huge hit. There are also hauntingly good marrowbone waffles 
                            with lumpfish roe, and cod tail glazed in ‘Barr-mite’ (Schmidt’s rich, oniony
                            version of Marmite). The schnitzel, meanwhile, is a Platonic ideal of the dish, 
                            with super-tender pork and a coating as crisp as the topping on a crème brûlée. 
                            The style is less hair-shirt and more cosseting than New Nordic places tend to be.
                            In a city that sees new openings wither on a wave of short-lived hubris, Barr 
                            stands apart for its consistency: it makes the stuff you want to eat, slightly 
                            differently than expected and much better than anyone else. Noma might be the 
                            once-in-a-lifetime experience, but Barr – which always has space for walk-ins – 
                            is the place to become a regular. Lightning can, it seems, strike twice.
