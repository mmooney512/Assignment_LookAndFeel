                            With more than three-quarters of Brits having travelled alone
                            or considering doing it in future, solo travel is no longer a
                            niche pursuit. But alert as we are to the many joys of solo travel,
                            it’s undeniable that the world looks different through one set of
                            eyes, and choosing your destination can mean the difference between
                            an incredible independent getaway and a less satisfying solo sojourn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Merging and mingling happens naturally in cities like New York,
                            Stockholm or Austin, cultural big-hitters where you’ll never run
                            out of things to do or people to talk to. Cities are action-packed
                            and anonymous, where a lone face is easily absorbed into the crowd
                            at an art gallery, or subsumed by a group of revellers on the dancefloor.
                            But adventure travel also favours the solitary traveller, and
                            adrenalin-oriented landscapes like South America, Southeast Asia and
                            the Caribbean lend themselves to lone adventures abroad. Festivals
                            provide a focal point and offer an instant pop-up community, and doing
                            any sport or activity – from skiing to cookery – immediately places
                            lone travellers within a tribe. Solo travellers are only ever as alone
                            as they want to be, so open your mind, and pick one of these, the best
                            solo travel destinations in the world.

                            <h3>COSTA RICA </h3>

                            It’s hard to imagine a coastline more abundantly blessed than Costa Rica’s,
                            and nature’s generosity is warmly extended to travellers. The hubs of
                            Tamarindo, Santa Teresa, Puerto Viejo, La Fortuna and Nosara are particularly
                            solo-traveller friendly places to start, and at friendly hostels such as Tamarindo
                            Backpackers (tamarindobackpackershostel.com), lone travellers land here and
                            immediately place themselves within a tribe of other yogis or surfers, or simply
                            find their crew while clambering through bat-bedecked caves or scaling volcanic peaks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the world’s most biodiverse nations, Costa Rica prioritises wildlife
                            preservation with a string of outdoor adventures on the menu and development
                            balanced by green energy such as hydro and wind power. This makes it a mecca
                            for a particular breed of eco-minded adventurer, a true feel-good destination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether you fancy hiking, mountain-biking, kayaking or even jungle ziplining
                            your way around the country, navigating Costa Rica is made easy for you, a
                            real bonus when you’re doing the schlep solo. Expect to rub up against reassuringly
                            familiar trends from home including farm-to-table dining, an emphasis on sustainable
                            travel, and achingly hip cafés – but Costa Rica remains both tantalisingly exotic
                            and tirelessly surprising.

                            <h3>CANADA</h3>
                            Canada’s cities are famously civilised, cultured and classy, but it’s the
                            outdoorsy assets within easy reach of Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver or
                            Ontario that make Canada such a mecca for solo travellers. As the globe's
                            second-biggest country, Canada offers a vast menu of landscapes, from soaring
                            mountains, remote beaches and wild tundra to lush rainforest, all spread across
                            six timezones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Adventure highlights include kayaking or rafting the South
                            Nahanni River in the Northwest Territories or navigating the swells and surf
                            of Nova Scotia, but the outdoors is also stamped firmly on Canadian cities,
                            so for outdoors-obsessed solo travellers, even the cities deliver. Vancouver’s
                            Stanley Park is that rare thing, a city park that really does feel a little rugged,
                            but spits you out a short cycle from one of the world’s greatest food markets and
                            streetfood scenes at Granville Island (granvilleisland.com).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Heading north out
                            of Vancouver, the quirky town of Dawson in the Yukon Territory offer a rich
                            taste of Canadian smalltown culture, with a music festival (dcmf.com) that
                            should belong on the list of any culture-craving solo traveller. Dawson is
                            also the launchpad for snow-based activities in the winter months, and hiking
                            and biking in the summertime.

                            <h3>THAILAND</h3>

                            Thailand is where it all started for travellers the world over, but
                            this South-east Asian idyll is still hard to beat when it comes to
                            transformational solo travel, with courses in everything from Thai cookery to
                            massage to yoga to scuba-diving, and a well-trodden route that makes Thailand
                            particularly safe for solo female travellers.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chiang Mai makes for a more
                            chilled urban Thai experience than Bangkok, as well as being a springboard
                            to Thailand’s waterfall-studded, rainforested north, and hippy hubs such as
                            Pai. For a treat, book into 137 Pillars (137pillarschiangmai.com; from £220 per night)
                            for 1880s Lanna architecture, but the warm Thai welcome extends to quirky,
                            charming and more budget-friendly flashpacker joints like Mo Rooms (morooms.com; from £42).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then head south to match with your own dream beach, whether it’s diving
                            with whale sharks off Ko Tao, combining health with hedonism on Ko Phang Nguan,
                            or kiteboarding and kicking back in Hua Hin. The serene spirituality of Thailand
                            as well as the fact that dining well is a gloriously democratic and informal
                            pleasure only adds to the country’s charms for solo adventurers; it’s genuinely
                            hard to feel stressed in Thailand.
