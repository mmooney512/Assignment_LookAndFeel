            <h3>Group Ten</h3>
            Jasmine Gilbert, Michael Mooney, Alyssa Sison
            <br />
            <hr />
            For design, please briefly describe your selected design guidelines:
            <h5>I. (3 point) Responsiveness – compatibility with small (mobile), medium (tablet) and large (desktop) screen sizes</h5>
            <p>
                We implemented a framework that allows for one to twelve columns. The column widths are designated in
                percentages to allow for dynamically re-sizing of the widths of the columns depending on the resolution
                of the user’s browser.  We used CSS style to dynamically reposition and re-size the DIV elements
                containing content.  We used the @media tag, to determine when the browser’s width reached certain
                thresholds.  In doing so we would hide or show elements on the web page, the top-menu bar will
                collapse to one item, and the other menu items would be replaced with a well known icon
                representing a drop down menu exists. The framework design allows for additional content
                to be added without adversely affecting the design or responsiveness of the website.
            </p>


            <h5>II. (3 points) Usability –ease of use and navigation of your interface end users</h5>
            <p>
                The web page has a top-navigation menu that uses color-coding highlighting to 
                indicate which section of the website the user is on. All links have a blue color 
                and are underlined to differentiate them from the normal black text. The resizing 
                and repositioning of the DIV elements for smaller screens ensures that the 
                top-navigation menu is always usable, and the text on the screen remains legible.
            </p>



            <h5>III. (6 points) Content – relevance of the content on the site</h5>
            <p>
                The website’s focus is on travel related articles.  The articles provide travellers with 
                suggestions of where to go and what to do while travelling. In addition the news section shows 
                recent articles of interest to travellers.  The articles have relevant images to capture the 
                reader’s attention and suggest the topic of the corresponding article. The articles included on 
                the site are representative in nature for the requirements of the assignment.
                <br />
                Additionally we used the charts.js package to create three easy to digest facts about 
                travel, i.e. an infographic page. The layout allows readers to quickly comprehend the 
                fact that is being presented in a visual manner, without overwhelming the reader with 
                details about the data.  We used three different chart types to keep the reader engaged.  
                We added a legend to the donut chart to help quickly identify the two groups represented.  
                And of course when using the mouse over feature a pop-up label appears.
            </p>


            <h5>IV. (4.5 points) Design – use of at least 3 specific design guidelines and ideas for web sites</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Accessibility - there were safe colors used for people with all different levels of vision and enough contrast between the font weightings and font color, so they don’t blend together into one.</li>
                <li>Conventionality - the structure of the site’s primary navigation is simple – the user can navigate to every page in the links on the top right, the logo is at the top left of the page, the logo is clickable so it always brings the user back to the homepage,  and links change color/appearance when the user hovers over them.</li>
                <li>Consistency - the overall look and feel of the site is consistent across all of the pages. There are different layouts on certain pages and they are being used consistently (for example – the Articles page has three pages with 3 different stories and with the same layout) this will make it easier for visitors to understand what type of information they're likely to find on a given page.</li>
            </ul>



            <h5>
                V. (1.5 points) Please add a comment to your submission, reflecting on your learnings, total time
                required and any recommendations for future assignments
            </h5>
            <p>
                The assignment was a great introduction to working with GitHub because it was basic enough 
                for us to understand what was going on through each push and pull. We were able to view each 
                change through each screen modification. Using GitHub was most useful in that it gave us a 
                chance to be more comfortable with using the application before working on the final project. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The chart.js documentation was also very informative with its easy instructions and 
                templates – all we needed to do was format some of the code to the site and plug in the data. 
                The assignment was great to work on because it’s something we can utilize after we 
                graduate – websites could be used for work, interests, etc. This assignment could be improved by 
                giving us more time to work on the webpage, a week to create this site didn’t feel like enough 
                time for what we wanted to do. Even though there has been better consistency between the different
                browsers, there is still some differences. Alought we feel our web framework is robust, if we had more 
                time we could have more throughly tested the look on a variety of browsers on a variety of devices. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Time spent was approximately 20-25 hours per team member <br />
            </p>
