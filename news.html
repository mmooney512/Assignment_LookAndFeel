                        <h4>United States Citizens Will Need a Visa to Visit Europe Starting in 2021</h4>
                        <p>
                            US citizens traveling to Europe without a visa will be a thing of the past come 2021.
                            The European Union announced on Friday that American travelers will need a new type of visa -- a European Travel Information and Authorization System or ETIAS -- to visit the European Schengen Area.
                            The Schengen Area is a zone of 26 European countries that do not have internal borders and allow people to move between them freely, including countries like Spain, France, Greece, Germany, Italy and Poland.
                            Currently, US citizens can travel to Europe for up to 90 days without a visa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The United States has been in a dispute with the EU's European Parliament and European Commission over visas for Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania and Cyprus. Travelers in those five countries are the only EU nations that the US requires to apply for a visa.
                            In 2016, the European Commission first released a report calling for the U.S. to grant the same visa-free status to those five countries as the other 23 EU nations in exchange for U.S. citizens maintaining the same visa-free status in the Schengen Area. EU rules require equal treatment for all member states.
                            The report also indicated, however, that the commission wanted to wait until after President Trump was in office to "push for full visa reciprocity."
                            In June 2018, the Parliament voted in favor of the Commission imposing visas on US citizens.

                            Abu Dhabi's Presidential Palace is Now Open to Visitors
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Abu Dhabi's "Palace of the Nation" has just opened its doors to the public, and it's every bit as impressive as you'd expect.
                            Based inside the Presidential Palace complex in the UAE capital, Qasr Al Watan pays homage to Arabian heritage and design.
                            Complete with huge white domes, lush gardens and dramatic chandeliers, the new landmark aims to give visitors a stronger understanding of the UAE's governing traditions and values.
                            a tall glass building: Abu Dhabi's new attraction Qasr Al Watan is housed within the Presidential Palace compound.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "In line with the UAE President's vision, I have given directives to allocate a building in the Presidential Palace compound, called Qasr Al Watan, 'Palace of the Nation'," he tweeted shortly before the opening.
                            "Visitor tours of the palace will serve as a knowledge base and boost cultural understanding of the UAE.
                            The ceremony was led by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, while deputy rulers from the seven emirates were also in attendance.
                            Qasr Al Watan's opening comes after the proclaimed success of Louvre Abu Dhabi, which launched in late 2017 and attracted one million visitors in its first year.
                            The entire Presidential Palace compound, which houses the formal offices of the President, the Vice President and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, had previously been closed to visitors.
                            Qasr Al Watan is open seven days a week from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
