                        <h4>Everyone Should Experience These Iconic American Road Trips</h4>
                        <p>
                            There’s this feeling you have when you realize you’re in a car with someone your own age and no adults for the first time. I remember being a freshman in high school when a senior said he’d drive me home from our cast party after closing night for Inherit The Wind. Being alone in a car — no one’s mom pulled up to the curb outside the party armed with questions like, “Did you girls have fun?” and “Who was there?” and “What did you do?” — was a dizzying level of freedom. All of a sudden, my hazy future was rendered more clearly. I’d get a car of my own one day. Then an apartment. And then…
                            This heady sensation is eventually eclipsed by your first real road trip. Picking your own route, listening to a playlist you made, eating gas station Funions — this is real living. It’s adulthood and adventure in equal measures, inextricably bound together. My first road trip was just a jaunt to Madison, Wisconsin from small-town Michigan, but I felt like Jack Kerouac. I was a lonely wanderer, out seeking answers along the endlessly unfolding tarmac.
                            Below you’ll find truly iconic American road trip routes. They’re adventures that will teach you about America… and yourself.

                            Be sure to stop for lots of greasy-as-all-get-out food. This is where a classic burger, onion rings, and chocolate malt taste just like they did back in the 50s. Try Delgadillo’s Snow Cap in Selgman or Mr. D’z Route 66 Diner in Kingman — two places where the roadside diner experience remains virtually unchanged in all the best ways. To work off those calories, visit Havasu Falls on the Havasupai Indian Reservation or… y’know… the Grand Canyon.Make sure not to miss: The city of Oatman, where wild mules roam the streets. The stories of the old west were tales of automation and technology (via the train network) changing lives for the cowboys and frontiersmen of old. There’s not much from that bygone era left anymore. Mostly it’s just Oatman, a dusty outpost famous for those feral mules, some abandoned mines, and a clapboard saloon that is unironically called “The Glory Hole.”
                            If that’s not your type of town, we don’t need to plan a road trip together.

                        <h4>Using Trello to Plan Your Next Vacation (Really)</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the perpetual, impossible quest for work-life balance, it makes sense to banish office productivity tools from home use. Or, at the very least, to restrict them to the company laptop.
                            Using them to plan a vacation? It probably sounds like heresy.
                            Enter Trello, the project-management dashboard that’s been adopted by 35 million-plus users (including Bloomberg Media) since its founding in 2011. The company isn’t just betting that its professional users will find utility in the tool to organize their social and personal lives, but also that it can change the way we think about brainstorming and booking travel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the uninitiated, Trello “boards” use a combination of “lists” (or columns) and “cards” (expandable pieces of information) to help streamline complicated projects across team members. The functionality is simple and intuitive: You can tag people to delegate tasks, add due dates to cards, sort cards on a calendar, and even upload images to yield a Pinterest-like effect.
                            There’s no one correct way to organize a Trello board for travel planning, but when you sign up for a new account, you can select “travel” as your primary purpose and get directed straight to a relevant template that sorts your vacation planning into sections such as “to do before trip,” “to eat and drink,” and “done.”
                            A better approach might be to sort activities and restaurants onto lists that are organized by date; others might break down experiences by type (outdoor adventure, museums, food and drinks) or by neighborhood. Select “Change Background” from the menu options on your board and voilà: You can pick a wallpaper to evoke your trip’s destination, making it feel less like work and more like play. Then add your travel companions to the board and assign them responsibilities such as having your foodie friend pare down the restaurants list, or getting the entire group to vote on which museum to prioritize by using the built-in polling tool.
